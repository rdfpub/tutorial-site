# Building, Running, and Deploying
Once you've finished the authoring of your data, templates, and other files,
it's time to package up your site for delivery.

## Building your site
rdfpub sites are built and run via [Docker](https://www.docker.com), a
technology that creates portable, self-contained, executable virtual
environments for apps. Docker generally recommends installing
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) as a means of
using Docker, but there are other options such as
[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). It is assumed that
you have some basic knowledge of Docker and how to use it, or the ability to
follow along with installation and build instructions.

assuming that you have a functional Docker CLI, you can build your site like
so:

```sh
docker run \\
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
  -v /path/to/your/site/directory:/rdfpub/input:ro \\
  ghcr.io/rdfpub/generator \\
  -t rdfpub/example
```

To explain each line of the above:

- `docker run` runs a container which is how the rdfpub site generator operates
- `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` mounts the host Docker socket
  in the container which is needed because the site generator itself uses
  Docker to build a Docker image of your site
- `-v /path/to/your/site/directory:/rdfpub/input:ro` mounts a host directory
  inside the container; in this case, your site directory is mapped to the
  `/rdfpub/input` directory inside the container which is where the site
  generator builds from; and the `ro` flag to mount it as read-only for
  extra safety
- `ghcr.io/rdfpub/generator` is the rdfpub site generator Docker image which is
  hosted at the
  [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
- `-t rdfpub/example` specifies how the image should be tagged, plus any other
  parameters to `docker buildx build`; you should supply your own image tag
  here, like `my-org/people-site` or such

If everything went well, you should see output from the build process as it
scans your site files and begins assembling everything. It will report any
errors that it encounters as it builds your site.

### Example
If you want to try building a working site, this tutorial site serves as a
working example. Assuming you have a working installation of Docker on your
local machine in addition to [git](https://git-scm.com/), you should be able to
run the following verbatim on the command line to build the tutorial site:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rdfpub/tutorial-site
docker run \\
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
  -v ./tutorial-site:/rdfpub/input:ro \\
  ghcr.io/rdfpub/generator \\
  -t rdfpub/tutorial-site
```

You should see the output of the build process as it assembles the tutorial
site. Once it's finished, you should be able to run the tutorial site from your
local machine as explained in the next section.

## Running your site
Once your site image is built, you can run it from the command line using
`docker run`. Continuing the tutorial site example, you can run it like so:

```sh
docker run -p 80:80 rdfpub/tutorial-site
```

The `-p 80:80` runs the container with port 80 (HTTP) inside the container
bound to your local machine's port 80 which allows you to access the site
using a web browser. You should be able to visit <http://localhost/> if
everything went according to plan.

## Deploying your site
To deploy your site, you'll need to leverage a service that allows you to run
Docker in a web-facing environment. All of the available services and the
various details of how to route web traffic to your live site is beyond the
scope of this tutorial, but here are a few major services that can run your
Docker containers:

- [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/deploy-with-docker)
