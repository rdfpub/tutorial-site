# Configuration
Although rdfpub heavily favors convention over configuration, every rdfpub
site needs some minimal configuration. Every site has its own configuration
file stored in a file at the site root named `.rdfpub`. It is a YAML file that
contains some global settings for the site that can't be reasonably
accommodated as a simple convention.

## Settings

Each of the configuration settings are listed below.

### BaseURI
Specifies the base URI that relative URI's throughout the site are resolved
against. For instance, `/foo/bar` is a relative URI that would be resolved
against `http://localhost` as `http://localhost/foo/bar`.

It is also the value that will be used to set the server name in the site's
Nginx (OpenResty) config.

This is a required string value that must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL. It
assumes no default value.

Example:
```yaml
BaseURI: https://example.com
```

### DefaultLanguage
Specifies the default language of the site. This value is used to specify the
language of index files that aren't tagged with their own language, and it's
used as the preferred language of a resource that is served by default if no
other language can be idenfied during content negotiation.

This is a required string value that must be an IETF language code, such as
`en` for English or `es` for Spanish. It assumes no default value.

Example:
```yaml
DefaultLanguage: en-us # United States English
```

### SPARQLEndpoint
Specifies the path of the site's SPARQL endpoint. The path is given special
treatment during the site build process in that it cannot have explicit RDF
files (it serves a SPARQL service description instead) and it responds to
SPARQL query requests.

This is a required string value that defaults to '/sparql' if not specified.
It should typically be left at its default value unless you have a very good
reason to change it.

Example:
```yaml
SPARQLEndpoint: '/sparql'
```

### Prefixes
Specifies global prefixes that are made available to all RDF formats that
support prefixes without having to declare them in each individual RDF file.
These prefixes are a map of a prefix name to a prefix URI. Note that you can
specify relative URI's as a prefix which will be resolved against your base
URI.

This value is optional although it is recommended to set a few common prefixes
that can make your RDF files and SPARQL queries more concise.

Example:
```yaml
Prefixes:
  rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
  rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
  relative: /foo/bar/ # resolves to something like http://example.com/foo/bar/
```

### ExcludeFiles
Specifies file patterns that are to be excluded from the site build. This is
useful to exclude certain files, such as Markdown files, that are useful as
site metadata but aren't meant to be published to the web. This value is a
list of regular expression patterns that match a file path (including the
file name).

This value is optional.

Example:
```yaml
ExcludeFiles:
  - '\.md$'
  - /documentation/
  - LICENSE
```

### IncludeFiles
Specifies file patterns that are to be explicitly included in the site build.
This is especially useful for 'dot files' -- files and directories that start
with a '.' -- which are normally excluded from a site build by default. This
value is a list of regular expression patterns that match a file path
(including the file name).

This value is optional.

Example:
```yaml
IncludeFiles:
  - '\.gitignore$'
  - '\.bashrc'
```

### CleanOutputDirectory
Specifies whether or not the output directory for the site should be deleted
before a build. Setting this value to `true` is potentially dangerous as it
will delete any output directory that it's able to delete which can cause
accidental data loss if it's pointed at the wrong directory.

This value defaults to `false` and is safer to leave at its default value.
It's mostly intended for local testing of the site init process when fast
testing cycles are wanted.

Example:
```yaml
CleanOutputDirectory: false
```

## Example configuration file
A great example of a configuration file can be found in [the tutorial site's
own .rdfpub file](/.rdfpub). The file has values for all possible settings and
comments that explain each of the settings in detail.
