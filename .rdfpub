# This is the configuration file for an rdfpub site. It is a YAML file that
# specifies various settings for the site it belongs to.

### BaseURI ###
# Specifies the base URI that relative URI's throughout the site are resolved
# against. For instance, /foo/bar is a relative URI that would be resolved
# against http://localhost as http://localhost/foo/bar.
#
# It is also the value that will be used to set the server name in the site's
# Nginx (OpenResty) config.
#
# This is a required string value that must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.
BaseURI: http://localhost

### DefaultLanguage ###
# Specifies the default language of the site. This value is used to specify the
# language of index files that aren't tagged with their own language, and it's
# used as the preferred language of a resource that is served by default if no
# other language can be idenfied during content negotiation.
#
# This is a required string value that must be an IETF language code, such as
# 'en' for English or 'es' for Spanish.
DefaultLanguage: en-us

### SPARQLEndpoint ###
# Specifies the path of the site's SPARQL endpoint. The path is given special
# treatment during the site build process in that it cannot have explicit RDF
# files (it serves a SPARQL service description instead) and it responds to
# SPARQL query requests.
#
# This is a required string value that defaults to '/sparql' if not specified.
# It should typically be left at its default value unless you have a very good
# reason to change it.
SPARQLEndpoint: "/sparql"

### Prefixes ###
# Specifies global prefixes that are made available to all RDF formats that
# support prefixes without having to declare them in each individual RDF file.
# These prefixes are a map of a prefix name to a prefix URI.
Prefixes:
  rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
  rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
  dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
  owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#
  tutorial: /vocab#

### ExcludeFiles ###
# Specifies file patterns that are to be excluded from the site build. This is
# useful to exclude certain files, such as Markdown files, that are useful as
# site metadata but aren't meant to be published to the web. This value is a
# list of regular expression patterns that match a file path (including the
# file name).
ExcludeFiles:
  - '.+\.md'
  - LICENSE

### IncludeFiles ###
# Specifies file patterns that are to be explicitly included in the site build.
# This is especially useful for 'dot files' -- files and directories that start
# with a '.' -- which are normally excluded from a site build by default. This
# value is a list of regular expression patterns that match a file path
# (including the file name).
IncludeFiles:
  - '\.rdfpub$'

### CleanOutputDirectory ###
# Specifies whether or not the output directory for the site should be deleted
# before a build. Setting this value to `true` is potentially dangerous as it
# will delete any output directory that it's able to delete which can cause
# accidental data loss if it's pointed at the wrong directory.
#
# This value defaults to `false` and is safer to leave at its default value.
# It's mostly intended for local testing of the site init process when fast
# testing cycles are wanted.
CleanOutputDirectory: false
