# i18n
Internationalization, commonly abbreviated as _i18n_, is the practice of
adapting a website or software to multiple languages. rdfpub supports i18n
out of the box, evidenced partially by the `DefaultLanguage` configuration
setting, but also via _language tags_ that can be specified for index files.
rdfpub uses the `Accept-Language` HTTP header as well as a `lang` cookie to
negotiate the most appropriate language for each user.

## Language negotiation
When a resource URL is accessed, the server receives information from the
client about what languages are acceptable to the user, and the server uses
this information to serve the most appropriate language possible for the given
URL. In rdfpub, this process is entirely transparent to both the author of an
rdfpub site and users who are browsing the site. As a site author, you simply
need to specify a language for each of your index files and your site will
automatically be configured to select the best available language for each
request.

## Language tags
To leverage language negotiation, your index files must be tagged with a
_language tag_. A language tag is specified as part of the index file's file
name using an `@` symbol followed by the appropriate IETF language code. For
instance, if you have three index files, one written in English, one written in
Spanish, and one written in Turkish, you would name your index files like so:

- `index@en.handlebars`
- `index@es.handlebars`
- `index@tr.handlebars`

Your site will then choose the most preferred index file based on the available
languages. If there is no overlap between the languages that the browser
requests and the languages that the server supports, then the server will
select the default language that you specify as the `DefaultLanguage` in your
`.rdfpub` configuration file. The default language is also applied to every
index file that doesn't have a language tag, so for instance you can have a
file named `index.handlebars` with `DefaultLanguage: se` in your `.rdfpub`
file, then internally during the site build, the file will be rendered as
`index@se.handlebars`. This simplifies sites that only support the default
language.

## The `lang` cookie
In many cases, the `Accept-Language` header that gets sent automatically by web
browsers will be sufficient for language negotiation, but not always. There are
many situations in which a user may want to select a different language:

- What if a user wants to see a page in a different language than they usually
  prefer?
- What if you want to send someone a link to a page in a specific language?
- What if the browser doesn't reflect the user's actual language, such as a
  shared computer in a public library?

These situations are not uncommon, and for reasons like these, it is widely
recommended that it be possible to manually select a language. rdfpub supports
this via language tags on resource URL's. If you want to fetch a resource in a
language that the resource supports, simply tack and `@` symbol and the
language code to the end of its URL, just like the language tag on an index
file. When you visit such a URL, the server sends a `lang` cookie with the
selected language code, such as `lang=en`, then redirects back to the main
resource. This `lang` cookie then takes precedence over all other languages.

As an example, you can [visit this page @en-us](./i18n@en-us) then check your
site cookies afterwards to see your `lang=en-us` cookie. This isn't the
greatest example as of this writing because the tutorial site only supports
en-us, but at least you can see the mechanism in action in your browser.
