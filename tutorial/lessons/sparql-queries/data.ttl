# SPARQL
SPARQL is the standard query language used to extract information from RDF
data. In rdfpub, SPARQL queries are used to extract information about your
resources for use in Handlebars templates.

## Creating SPARQL queries
A SPARQL query is created for each `.sparql` file in your site directory. The
'name' part of the file (the file name minus the `.sparql` extension) is used
to reference the results of the query in Handlebars templates.

## Query inheritance
When an rdfpub site is built, SPARQL queries are recursively copied down from
its own directory to all subdirectories. This allows you to write a generic
SPARQL query that all 'child' resources can use without having to duplicate
your queries for every resource that needs them.

## Generic queries
In order to make queries generic, rdfpub will run your query against every
resource that inherits it with two special variables:

- `$resource` - the resource that the query is being executed for
- `$language` - the current language that is currently being queried for
  (explained in greater detail in
  [the i18n lesson](/tutorial/lessons/i18n))

With these two variables, you can write queries that can apply to any resource
that they're run for. For instance, let's say that you want to write a SPARQL
query that extracts a name and description for a person. Such a query might
look like this:

```sparql
SELECT $name $description
WHERE {
  GRAPH $resource {
    $resource a foaf:Person
    ; foaf:name $name
    ; dcterms:description $description
  }
}
```

If you define this query as `person.sparql` in a directory `/person`, then
every resource in a subdirectory will receive this query with its own values
injected into it. So `/person/Alice` and `/person/Bob` would have their own
set of results for this query based on their individual URL's and RDF data.

A good example of such a query is
[the `lesson.sparql` query](https://github.com/rdfpub/tree/main/tutorial/lessons/lesson.sparql)
for this tutorial site. Note how `$resource` is used to extract information
about each lesson that the query gets passed down to.

## Supported SPARQL query types
As of this writing, only SPARQL tuple queries are supported, that is, queries
that return SPARQL results created from a `SELECT` query. All of `ASK`,
`CONSTRUCT`, and `DESCRIBE` are intended to be supported in the future. For
now, `SELECT` queries should suffice for almost all practical purposes.

## SPARQL endpoint
The rdfpub site generator creates a
[SPARQL endpoint](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) for every site that
it generates. This endpoint can be used to make arbitrary SPARQL queries over
your data. This can be useful for anyone looking to examine or analyze your
data. It also allows others to federate their own SPARQL queries to your site
by way of the `SERVICE` SPARQL keyword, thus connecting datasets across the
web.

As is common convention, an rdfpub site's SPARQL endpoint is served from the
`/sparql` URL by default. It is a
[SPARQL 1.1 compliant endpoint](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)
except that it does not support SPARQL update operations as rdfpub sites are
static-ish read-only sites. It also serves
[SPARQL 1.1 service description](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/)
data which describes the SPARQL endpoint and the features/data it supports.

Lastly, you can publish an HTML page for your SPARQL endpoint by putting an
`index.handlebars` file in your SPARQL endpoint directory. This tutorial site
does exactly that with [its own SPARQL endpoint](/tutorial/sparql). Index
templates are explained in
[the next lesson](/tutorial/lessons/handlebars-templates).

If you want to see a live query in action, you can try it for yourself with
[this query to fetch lessons](/tutorial/sparql?query=SELECT%20%24url%20%24name%20WHERE%20%7B%20GRAPH%20%24url%20%7B%20%24url%20a%20%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Frdf.pub%2Ftutorial%2Fvocab%23Lesson%3E%20%3B%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fdc%2Fterms%2Ftitle%3E%20%24name%20%7D%20%7D)
from this tutorial site's SPARQL endpoint.
