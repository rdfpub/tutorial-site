# Static files
Static files are simple files that rdfpub serves exactly as they are. Any file
that isn't an RDF, SPARQL, or Handlebars file gets copied to the output
directory as a static file which can be accessed via its URL the way that you'd
expect.

The site configuration attempts to send a `Content-Type` header that is
appropriate for common file types according to
[its list of MIME types](https://github.com/rdfpub/generator/blob/main/init/src/main/resources/types.nginx.conf)
which covers a good majority of common file types served from the web. Any file
type that isn't listed gets served as plain text (`text/plain` MIME type).

## Caveats
Static files are very simplistic and they do not enjoy the same benefits of
content and language negotiation that resources do. If you need to support
static files for alternate languages or file formats, you'll need to provide
each alternate as a separate file. And as of this writing, static files are not
automatically compressed during the site build for more efficient delivery the
way resources are, so large static files that can benefit from compression
(zip, gzip, 7zip, etc.) should be compressed in your site source directory.
